I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple data entry program that uses SQLite, I created this program for practing.

I used Qt Designer to make the layout.

I use SQL a lot and this project will keep me in practice.

Click on run.bat to run the program.

Best Regards,<br/>
Brian
